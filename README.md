# docker-openresearch-stack (DORS)

Build a local OpenResearch Stack (MediaWiki &amp; extensions) with Docker.

## Project structure

### `docker-compose.yml`
Configuration file used by Docker Compose that defines services, networks, and volumes for DORS.

### `Makefile`
Main entry point and command line interface to test, build, run, destroy DORS.

### `/context`
A set of files "baked" into the Docker image. The build process can reference any of the files in the context.

## Requirements

#### Docker
```
docker --version
```

```

## Getting started

## Release
- Set version in `context/Dockerfile` following the [Semantic Versioning Specification](https://semver.org/):

        ARG OPENRESEARCH_STACK_VERSION=5.1.0-alpha1

- Commit your changes with comment "prepared <OPENRESEARCH_STACK_VERSION>"
- Start a new "release" in GitHub. This will
	- run the CI process,
	- build the Docker image,
	- and release the image with the correct version tagged
